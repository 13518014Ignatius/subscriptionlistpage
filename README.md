# Subscription List Page

This is a subscription list web page project. This project was developed using Vue 3 framework. This program uses PayPal API for payment. Due to time constraints, some things were implemented in the development phase where they should not be in the final product, such as the use of the Sandbox PayPal API to simulate transactions and localStorage as the database of the page. With more time, improvements can be made into this project, such as more CSS styles for the web page, a .env file to store environment-specific information such as Client ID and Secret, a proper database like PostgreSQL, and a live PayPal API.
